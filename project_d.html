            <ul>This site was fully developed by me as both a demonstration of my programming skills and a reflection of who I am as a person.</ul>
            <ul>I chose a minimalist, clean design to highlight my focus on clarity and usability. In a similar sense, I apply these values to all of my work, ensuring my projects are mantainable and scalable, a key component of any programming project. I keep the content available and open-source, allowing my work to be more easily integrated with other systems.</ul>
            <ul>One of the most meaningful aspects of this site is its commitment to accessibility. Accessibility plays a significant role in my life, and Iâ€™ve worked to ensure the site aligns with ADA and WCAG standards. This includes alt text for all buttons and images, a consistent and legible font, a high-contrast color palette, and full keyboard navigability. These policies not only play a role into my identity, but also reflects my commitment to contributing toward a more inclusive and equitable digital environment. </ul>
            <ul>This project also pushed me outside my comfort zone. While JavaScript and HTML aren't my strongest languages, I took on the challenge and grew through the process. Compared to my earlier web tools, this project required a greater level of structure and cohesion: skills I developed and applied throughout many personal projects.</ul>
